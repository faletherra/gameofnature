This is project for IDEA9103: Creative Coding 

Our final project was an interactive game simulating marine ecosystems and the impact of ocean pollution. I led on concept research and contribute to some debugging. Through this course on creative coding, I learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

How to play the game?
Users can increase or decrease the Prey (small fish)
Users can increase or decrease the predators (Big fishes)
Increase the thrash thrown into the ocean
​
Simulating the ecosystem in the ocean:
In an ocean simulation, predators chase prey, which turns green in danger. Low-energy predators turn yellow and slow down. After eating, they turn red, gaining energy.
​
Introducing foreign objects such as thrash:
As trash accumulates, the ocean darkens, fully black after 40 clicks, ending the game. Predators near trash die, simulating fish deaths from ingestion
